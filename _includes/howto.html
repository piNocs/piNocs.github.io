  <h2>How to use the Pi-noculars</h2>
  <p>
    The Raspberry Pi is programmed to run a video on a loop as soon as it is plugged in. A after running for nine hours, the Pi shuts off on it's own.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's it! Plug it in and it works. The Pi is plugged into a timer and should maintain itself. If people are seeing a blue screen, unplug it then plug it back in. If you ever find yourself handling the device, please be gentle.

  <p class="text-danger">
    Only unplug the device if you see a blue screen! By unplugging it unexpectedly, the SD card could become corrupt and the program will need to be <a href="#dev-info" class="insite-nav">reinstalled</a>. If you find yourself needing to turn off the device, check out the <a href="#shutdown-instructions" class="insite-nav">shutdown instructions</a>.
