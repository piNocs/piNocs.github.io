    <h2>Developer Info</h2>
    
    <h6>About the script</h6>
    <p>
        The script runs from <code>/etc/rc.local</code>. It consists of a few lines that run a loop on omxplayer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The script shuts down the Pi after nine hours of runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        The video must be saved in the <code>boot</code> partition as <code>video.mp4</code>.
    </p>

    <h6>Accessing the Pi</h6>
    <p>
        The program runs off of rc.local for simplicity. To access the pi, you will need to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md">connect via SSH</a>. The Pi is already configured for this, just follow the directions in the link.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once given access, enter <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code>. Hash out the program I wrote and reboot. You can now play with the Pi!
    </p>

    <h6>Reinstalling the backup</h6>
    <p>
        If you need to reinstall the operating system and my program, <a href="mailto:pinocs@bowen-dev.com">get in touch with me</a>. You will need to remove the SD card from the Pi and we will troubleshoot from there.
